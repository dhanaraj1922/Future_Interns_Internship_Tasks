  - [WebGoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/)  
- Test using tools like:
  - [OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/)
  - [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
  - [SQLMap](https://sqlmap.org/)
- Identify common vulnerabilities:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Missing Security Headers
- Map results to [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- Prepare a **Security Report** including:
  - Screenshot evidence
  - Vulnerability impact
  - Recommended mitigations

## 📧 Task 2 – Phishing Awareness Training

### ✅ Objectives
- Create an **awareness module** covering:
  - Types of phishing attacks (email, website, spear-phishing, vishing)
  - Real-world phishing examples
  - Social engineering tactics
  - Best practices to identify and avoid phishing
- Include:
  - Interactive quizzes
  - Visual examples (legit vs. fake)
  - Simulation exercises (optional)
- Deliverables:
  - PowerPoint / PDF training module
  - Reference guide for end-users

## 📡 Task 3 – Basic Network Sniffer

### ✅ Objectives
Build a Python-based network packet sniffer for capturing and analyzing live traffic.

### 🧱 Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: `scapy` / `socket`  
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux/Windows)

### 🧩 Features
- Capture live packets from selected network interfaces
- Display:
  - Source & destination IP
  - Protocol
  - Packet length
- Save captured packets to `.pcap` for Wireshark analysis
- Include filters for protocol-specific capture
