# Future_Interns_Internship_Tasks
This project demonstrates hands-on security testing of a vulnerable web application using powerful industry tools like OWASP ZAP, SQLMap, and WebGoat. The goal was to detect, exploit, and document common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and missing security headers.
